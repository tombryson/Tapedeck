        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>Tapedeck is an exciting new way to share your favourite mix compilations and albums.<br>
        Gone are the days of relying on word of mouth or good reviews to find and enjoy new albums. <br>
        At Tapedeck, our philosophy is that we trust listeners to create and share the very best music has to offer, not some shady algorithm from faceless corporates. <br>
        Our user-driven content allows for a more organic and accurate method for providing recommendations and because every tapedeck is user-specific, you can keep up-to-date with the latest flavours and feelings shared by our mixologists.
